# Cactus Fever*

## Presentation

It's symfony website-skeleton project with some additional library (webpack, fixtures) and tools to validate code standards.

* GrumPHP, as pre-commit hook, will run 2 tools when `git commit` is run :
  
    * PHP_CodeSniffer to check PSR12 
    
  If tests fail, the commit is canceled and a warning message is displayed to developper.

### Prerequisites

1. Check composer is installed
2. Check yarn & node are installed

### Install

1. Clone this project
2. Run `composer install`
3. Run `yarn install`
4. Run `yarn encore dev` to build assets
5. Create a file .env.local in root (copy of .env file)
6. Configure your database in .env.local

### Working

1. Run migrations files with `bin/console d:m:m`
2. Run `symfony server:start` to launch your local php web server
3. Run `yarn run dev --watch` to launch your local server for assets

==> A special user with admin role is created. Ask me for password to test admin panel

### Testing

`git config --global core.autocrlf true`
